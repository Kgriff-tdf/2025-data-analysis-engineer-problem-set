WITH NumberedPages AS (SELECT ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY (page_number)) - 1  AS row_index, page_number, title FROM cookbook_titles),

Select alp.even_numbers as left_page_number

from allLeftpages alp 
left join left_title lt on alp.even_numbers = lt.page_number
left join right_title rt on alp.even_numbers = rt.page_number - 1
